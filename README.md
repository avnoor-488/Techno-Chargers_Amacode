## How does an Amacode delivery work?

Amacode is similar to QR-code, it is a unique code generated when a customer places an order. That code consists of the packaging wrap id and tracking id. First, the outer seal bag consists of the Amacode, when you scan that code, you will need to log in using your amazon account through which you placed your order, if you are able to see your product, you will see that unique generated code when you click on it. You open the sealed bag and the packaging box. You will see a paper-wrapped package, packaging wrap id will be printed on the inner side of the new paper wrap that is put over the product, so if someone tries to open that package and tries to wrap it again it will get tampered with and thus the customer will know that there has been some issue with the delivery, if someone rewraps it they won't be able to as they don't have that unique code it is only accessible to the customer when he scans the Amacode and logs in. If the wrap is intact then the inner product hasn't been switched. And even after that if the product comes out to be something else, it means the seller is responsible for the delivered product and is selling counterfeit products or is doing some fishy business, it has nothing to do with the delivery hubs. Thus this creates a secure doorstep delivery, with just one unique code that will track as well as protect your valuable item from getting switched.
